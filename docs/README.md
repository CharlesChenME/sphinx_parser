# Stinx

## Overview

Stinx is a sibling repository of the DFT code [Sphinx](https://sxrepo.mpie.de). It provides the python parser to generate the input files for the Sphinx code.

## How to use

Stinx's input parser is created from the yaml-file located at `src/input_data.yml`. The input file is generated by `src/generator.py`. You can use the parser via:

```python
from sphinx_parser.input import sphinx
```

This instance `sphinx` is used to create all possible input classes for Sphinx by choosing the class via dot-notation and call `create`. For example in order to generate the class `kPoints`, you can run:

```pythoon
kPoints = sphinx.basis.kPoints.create()
```

You can find the input in the parent class, i.e.:

```python
basis = sphinx.basis.create(kPoints=kPoints)
```

Finally, you can translate it into the Sphinx format via:

```python
from sphinx_parser.toolkit import to_sphinx

sphinx_input = to_sphinx(basis)
```

You can then write it to a file via:

```python
with open('sphinx.in', 'w') as f:
    f.write(sphinx_input)
```
